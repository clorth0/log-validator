# Syslog File Validator

This Python script is designed to validate log files according to specific format and content requirements as it relates to [M21-31 requirements]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/M-21-31-Improving-the-Federal-Governments-Investigative-and-Remediation-Capabilities-Related-to-Cybersecurity-Incidents.pdf). It checks each log entry for proper formatting, presence of required data fields, and correct data formats.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Setup

No additional libraries are required to run this script. It uses standard Python libraries.

## Usage

Place your syslog file in the same directory as the script, or provide the path to the syslog file when running the script.

Run the script with:
```bash
python syslog_file_validator.py
```

## Features

The script validates the following components in each syslog entry:

1. Timestamp
2. Hostname
3. Tag
4. Message content
5. Priority value (optional, based on your syslog format)

Each part is parsed and validated using regular expressions and specific validation logic defined in the script.

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the regular expressions and validation logic to match your specific syslog file format and requirements.

## Note

This script is a template and might require adjustments to fit the specific format and requirements of your syslog files. Ensure to replace placeholder regex patterns with the ones that match your syslog file's format.
